# React Native documents viewer

## Install

```
yarn install
```

## Run

```
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Tests

```
jest
```

## Dependencies
  - react-native-paper - Material UI Kit (there are plenty of them, I choosed one of them. As usual, it was easier to avoid kit and do everything by myself.)
  - react-native-simple-toast - Native toast notifications
  - react-query
  - react-hook-form
  
  Used last two just for learning purposes (never used them in production before).
